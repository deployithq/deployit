## Support

While there are many different channels that you can use to get hold of us (Issues, Forums/Mailing lists), you can help make sure that we are efficient in getting you the help that you need.

Before opening a new issue, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.

If you need support, start with the troubleshooting guide and work your way through the process that we've outlined.

That said, if you have questions, reach out to us one way or another. We don't bite!
