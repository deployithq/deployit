== Design manifest

The Design section described the parts of the Last.Backend platform and the abstractions to helps you obtain a deeper understanding of how it works.

=== Overview

Last.Backend platform is a set of processes of 2 types: master processes and minion processes. Master processes operates with cluster state, non-master applying state on physical machines.
In the core of design principles of Last.Backend there are runtime objects(manifests). Using manifest, you can change Last.Backend cluster state.
Manifests can be 2 types:
- external - to pass changes into cluster
- internal - intercommunication system manifests

=== Manifests

There is only 1 endpoint to handle manifests - the REST API. Manifests can be several types:
- Namespace manifest
- Service manifest
- Secret manifest
- Config manifest
- Route manifest

In the internal communication process Last.Backend also uses manifests:

- Node manifest: - collection of node state manifests:
  - Pod manifests - map of pod manifests, that should be on node
  - Endpoint manifests - map of endpoints manifests, that should be on node
  - Volume Manifests - map of volumes manifests
  - Congig Manifests -  map of config manifests
  - Secret Manifests - map of secrets manifests
  - Subnets Manifests - network subnets manifests
  - Resolvers Manifests - cluster resolvers manifests

- Ingress manifest:
  - Resolvers Manifests - cluster resolvers manifests
  - Endpoint manifests - map of services endpoint manifests
  - Routes manifests - map of routes manifests

More about manifests you can read in particular object section in this docs. For example service manifest is described in Serices section.

=== Processes

We can separate all Last.Backend processes in to types:
- master processes
- minion processes

To master process group we can set: REST API, Controller, Discovery and Ingress
To minion process group we can set node.

All master process can be horizontally scaled, except controller. It can be also scaled, but master process should be one, others will be set as slaves.

Last.Backend REST API is designed to setup cluster state directly or with command line interface application.
The main REST API function is to validate incomming changes, and pass they into database.

Last.Backend Controller is a process that operates for cluster state match.
After state is changed, controller start applying changes to make cluster state match.
The main design of controlles - is to handle current state, receive new update from database and preform a variety of automated tasks such as creating new deployment, pod, changind replicas, scheduling containers and volumes, and more.
Controller handles all cluster state and watches nodes state, handles capacity cluster information and more data. It also performs cluster automated tasks, based on nodes or ingress states.
For example it can reschedule pods after not rechanble timeout.

Last.Backend Discovery - is service discovery process, that handles all information on services registrations and internal domain names. In two words it is an internal DNS server for services.

Last.Backend Ingress - is the entry point for external traffics to internal network. It is auto-configured HAproxy server, which proxy traffic by routes rules to internal endpoints.

Last.Backend minion node - is a minion process that perform all operations with containers, volumes and networks on physical machine.
Node communicates with REST API. It pull state changes and send current state information about pods, volumes, endpoint, system info and more.

=== Storage

Last.Backend uses storage package to store information about cluster state.

As main database Last.Backend uses ETCDv3. For more information about storage tree and available methods, you can read design/storage section.
Etcd is a distributed key value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines.
Itâ€™s an open-source and available on GitHub. etcd gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and will tolerate machine failure, including the leader.

More information about ETCD you can read on the main etcd website: https://coreos.com/etcd/[https://coreos.com/etcd/]
